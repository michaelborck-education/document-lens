    The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) released its 
    annual report for the 2024-2025 financial year. The report highlights 
    significant regulatory achievements and outlines future strategic priorities.
    
    Key findings include improved market integrity and enhanced consumer protection 
    measures. The Commission processed over 50,000 complaints and conducted 
    numerous enforcement actions throughout the reporting period.
    
    According to Smith et al. (2024), regulatory frameworks continue to evolve 
    in response to emerging technologies. The implementation of new guidelines 
    has been praised by industry stakeholders (Jones, 2023).

    directly. The full report is available at DOI: 10.1234/asic.2024.report

    Introduction
    
    This study examines the relationship between corporate governance and 
    financial performance in Australian listed companies. Previous research 
    has established significant correlations between board composition and 
    firm value (Brown & Taylor, 2022; Williams, 2021).
    
    The methodology follows established protocols as described by Johnson (2020). 
    Data was collected from the ASX 200 companies over a five-year period 
    (2019-2024). Statistical analysis was performed using regression models 
    as recommended by Anderson et al. (2019).
    
    Results indicate a positive correlation (r=0.72, p<0.001) between board 
    independence and return on equity. These findings align with theoretical 
    predictions (Porter, 2018) and international studies (Chen & Liu, 2023).
